# Spot-Spine

This ImageJ plugin allows to detect and count dendritic spines, to segment spine heads, to trace spine necks, to obtain quantitative morphological measurements.

Spine detection and spine heads segmentation use algorithms from the plugin [3D ImageJ Suite](https://mcib3d.frama.io/3d-suite-imagej/).

Spine necks tracing uses algorithms from the plugin [SNT](https://imagej.net/plugins/snt/).
